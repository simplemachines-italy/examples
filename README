Welcome to Alcor6L examples!
(A fork of eLua examples, github.com/elua/examples.git)

This is a little project that maintains some basic and intermediate
level examples of Alcor6L code running on it's supported platforms.
Each example is kept separetely in it's own sub-folder.

These examples (and others that became individual projects also found
on our github repo) used to be part of our distros, included in the
ROMFS. They were removed from the distro to keep it smaller, cleaner
and not oriented to a single type of audience.

You are welcome to extend these examples to new platfoms and to add
new ones too! Anything that can help new users to quickly understand
the basics of Alcor6L/eLua is welcome here.

For information and tutorials about each of these examples, please
refer to:
